###Foldy Sheet Generator (by Hook)
####1. Introduction
The Foldy Sheet Generator is a script designed to create foldy sheets for tournament brackets. While it is optimized for the German League of Legends League (Primeleague, rules described below), all parameters can be customized to fit other tournament formats. Additionally, an example file for the Primeleague split teams is included.

####2. Primeleague Rules
The Foldy Sheet Generator is specifically tailored for the German League of Legends League, Primeleague. As a result, the default parameters are pre-configured to align with this particular tournament format. Any changes in the tournament rules will automatically adjust the default parameters accordingly.

The Primeleague format consists of a single round-robin stage, consisting of 2 matches per team. Each match can result in a win, loss, or draw. After all matches are played, the top two teams will qualify for the playoffs. Tiebreakers will always be played, and there are no head-to-head scores.

####3. Usage
Using the Foldy Sheet Generator requires some knowledge of Python. While a user-interface is currently under development, for now, you can customize the variables by following the comments provided in the code.
