# FOLDY SHEET GENEATOR (by Hook)



### 1. Intorduction

This script can be used, in order to create foldy sheets for tournament brackets. While this script is optimized for the german League of Legends League (Primeleague, rules down below), you can still change all parameters. An example file of my teams primeleague split is also included.


### 2. Rules of Primleague

As already said, this tool is optimized for the german league of legends league. Therefore all parameters are already set for this specifiy tournament format. The defualt parameters will also change with any change of rules.

The format is a single round robin containing of 2 matches. Therefore two teams can either end their match with win, loose or a draw. After all matches are played the best two teams will qualify for playoffs. Tiebreakers will always be played and there is no head to head score.

### 3. Usage

This script requires some knowledge of python. A User-Interface is in development. The variables you need to change are also described with comments int the code.
